## Introduction
A curriculum vitae (CV) serves as a concise overview of an individual's qualifications and professional background. For organizations, recruiters, and HR teams, sifting through numerous resumes poses a significant challenge. Manually sorting through candidate resumes consumes time and resources and hampers productivity. Consequently, recruiters employ resume classification to streamline the screening process, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to efficiently collect, store, and organize extensive resume databases. This enables easy searchability and analysis of resume data.

Resumes exemplify unstructured data, presenting various formats, text arrangements, and category headings. With no universally accepted resume layout, each resume may adopt its own unique style and structure. Establishing a resume classification system and extracting relevant information from these varied layouts is a formidable undertaking due to the myriad of resume designs available.

#### ✔The process of analyzing data involves several key steps, including data collection, text mining, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.

#### ✔In this project, we focused on building a Resume Classification Model using Python and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging Python's libraries, we implemented various NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and parts of speech tagging.

#### ✔The main objective of resume classification is to analyze resume data and extract information in a machine-readable format. This automated approach enables efficient storage, organization, and analysis of resume data, facilitating the identification of suitable candidates for specific job positions and requirements.

#### ✔To achieve this goal, we employed different data analysis methods and utilized Machine Learning models and NLP techniques. This allowed us to classify resume categories and construct the Resume Classification Model.
