### Introduction
A curriculum vitae (CV) serves as a concise overview of an individual's qualifications and professional background. For organizations, recruiters, and HR teams, sifting through numerous resumes poses a significant challenge. Manually sorting through candidate resumes consumes time and resources and hampers productivity. Consequently, recruiters employ resume classification to streamline the screening process, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to efficiently collect, store, and organize extensive resume databases. This enables easy searchability and analysis of resume data.

Resumes exemplify unstructured data, presenting various formats, text arrangements, and category headings. With no universally accepted resume layout, each resume may adopt its own unique style and structure. Establishing a resume classification system and extracting relevant information from these varied layouts is a formidable undertaking due to the myriad of resume designs available.
